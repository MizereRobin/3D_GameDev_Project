###Project to Uni class: 3D gameDevelopment

# <GAME NAME>

#Goal
The goal is to make a simple Unity 3D story game with some interesting functions ex:
- main menu
- pause menu
- switch between 3D and 2D
- a low-budget character customisation
- customizable controls
- lights? (is lights a thing for the project?)

#Story
The main character is an engineer in an underground Uranium mine. The mine is shut down because of maintenance. You visited a tunnel, the chemical things in the soil, but no workers around, just some engineers. Fire alarm sets on, you have to run out before smoke (if there is a fire) catches you.

#Game Mechanics
- large areas are in 3D, when you goes trough a tunnel it switches to 2D to make everithing difficult
- basic movement (WASD)
- jump (SPACE)
- crouch (CTRL)
- sprint (SHIFT)
- Quick-Time events (WASD only)
- Closing sector doors
